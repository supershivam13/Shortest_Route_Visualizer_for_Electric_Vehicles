// BELLMAN–FORD ALGORITHM

// OVERVIEW OF THE ALGORITHM :

    // Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph.
    // The graph may contain negative weight edges.


    // We have discussed Dijkstra’s algorithm for this problem. 
    // Dijkstra’s algorithm is a Greedy algorithm and time complexity is O(VLogV) (with the use of Fibonacci heap). 
    // Dijkstra doesn’t work for Graphs with negative weight edges, Bellman-Ford works for such graphs. 
    // Bellman-Ford is also simpler than Dijkstra and suites well for distributed systems. 
    // But time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE), which is more than Dijkstra's algorithm.

    // Algorithm
    // Following are the detailed steps.

    // Input: Graph and a source vertex src

    // Output: Shortest distance to all vertices from src. If there is a negative weight cycle, 
    // then shortest distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.

    // 1) This step initializes distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as 0. 
    // Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is source vertex.

    // 2) This step calculates shortest distances. Do following |V|-1 times where |V| is the number of vertices in given graph.
    // …..a) Do following for each edge u-v
    // ………………If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v]
    // ………………….dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv

    // 3) This step reports if there is a negative weight cycle in graph. Do following for each edge u-v
    // ……If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then “Graph contains negative weight cycle”
    // The idea of step 3 is, step 2 guarantees the shortest distances if the graph doesn’t contain a negative weight cycle.
    // If we iterate through all edges one more time and get a shorter path for any vertex, 
    // then there is a negative weight cycle
